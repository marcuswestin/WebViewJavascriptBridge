Version History
---------------

Intended v5.0.0
+ Removed `WebViewJavascriptBridge -reset`. It should never have been exposed as a public API.
+ Fixed compilation in C99 mode

Next version
+ Pretty-print json in log messages

v4.1.4
+ Improve how WVJB handles the case when there is no ObjC handler for a message received from js.

+ Fix bug: webViewDidStart/FinishLoad were called twice and isLoading was always true (#86)

v4.1.1

+ Drop support for JSONKit
+ Clean up internal represenation of messages

v4.0.2

v4.0.1
+ Fix detection of arc_weak support

v4.0.0

v3.0.0
+ OSX Support

v2.1.2
+ Copy handler and response blocks

v2.1.1
+ Handle edge cases gracefully (e.g. don't crash on unknown command or unexpected response)

v2.1.0
+ Remove WVJBResponse object and the notion of responding with an error. See 4ab41bb4d7.

v2.0.0
+ Messages are objects instead of strings. Supports NSDictionary*/Objects, NSArray*/Arrays, NSNumber*/Number & NSString*/String.
+ Messages are encoded with NSJSONSerialization. Optional fallback to JSONKit for iOS 4 support.
+ Messages can expect responses. A message received with an expected response is accompanied by a WVJBResponse* object.
+ Handlers can be registered by name, and called with data and an optional expected response.
+ Responses expect either an error or data (`-(void)respond:(id)data`, -(void)respondWithError:(id)error)

v0.0.1
+ ObjC: A WebViewJavascriptBridge class (a UIWebViewDelegate) that enables message passing to and from the JS
+ ObjC: A protocol called WebViewJavascriptBridgeDelegate that lets you handle messages received from the JS
+ JS: Event when the bridge is ready - document.addEventListener('WebViewJavascriptBridgeReady', function() {}, false)
+ JS: Ability to set your message handler - WebViewJavascriptBridge.setMessageHandler(function() {})
+ JS: Function to send messages - WebViewJavascriptBridge.sendMessage('a message');
+ All messages are strings. Use JSON in your js and e.g. JSONKit in iOS to send structured messages
